          The headmaster of the school where I served urged me that I should go even further and pursue a Ph.D. In response, I only laughed, reminding me that by the time I reached her, I would already be fifty. To which the director said: "You will be fifty anyway."

          <li>We are hungry. We crave approval, attention, affection. We long for the freedom to accept life, to know ourselves and to be ourselves.</li>

        <li>  Freeing ourselves from the consciousness of the victim, we thus free other people from the roles to which we appointed them during our lives. </li> <li>

Time doesn't heal. We manage ourselves, over time. Recovery will come when we choose to take responsibility, when we take risks, and when we finally allow ourselves to let go of the pain of the heart, that is, let go of grief and let go of the past. And all this is a matter of our choice. </li> <li>

Remember: you have something that no one else will ever have. You have you. For life.</li> <li>

You can't feel love and fear at the same time.</li>

        Edith Eva Eger was sent with her family to Auschwitz at a young age. There, her parents died in the gas chamber, and Edith and her sister experienced all the horrors of the disgusting death camps. 35 years after the end of the war, having become a famous psychologist, Edith returned to Auschwitz to get rid of the memories of the past and the guilt of the survivor. </br>
This book is not just a memoir of a Holocaust survivor, it is an unforgettable chronicle of heroism and resilience, mercy and healing. It shows that we can always choose what life teaches us and how to relate to what is happening. </i>
